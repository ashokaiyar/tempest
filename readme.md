# WeatherFlow Tempest UDP Relay

A fast and efficient UDP relay service designed to receive WeatherFlow Tempest locally broadcasted [UDP JSON data](https://weatherflow.github.io/SmartWeather/api/udp/v143/), optionally repackage it into the Ecowitt format, and then POST it to Hubitat for consumption.

## Features

- LAN communication only, no cloud/weather service needed.
- Entirely written in C++ with no dependencies, external libraries or additional packages to install.
- Small, fast, efficient and highly asynchronous with non-blocking I/O and multithreaded queue.
- Designed to leverage existing Hubitat driver infrastructure by emulating WeatherFlow REST API or Ecowitt protocols.

## Installation Instructions

- Copy the single ```tempest``` executable to your host (PC, VM, RPi etc.)
- Make sure the file is executable. If you are using Linux run the following command:

  ```text
  chmod +x tempest
  ```

- If the host running the relay has a firewall, don't forget to open incoming port UPD 50222. If, for example, you are using UFW, you can use the following command:

  ```text
  sudo ufw allow 50222/udp
  ```

- Run the executable with the appropriate arguments:

  ```text
  Usage:        tempest [OPTIONS]

  Commands:

  Start:        tempest --url=<url> [--format=<fmt>] [--interval=<min>]
                        [--log=<lev>] [--daemon]
  Trace:        tempest --trace [--format=<fmt>] [--interval=<min>]
                        [--log=<lev>]
  Stop:         tempest --stop
  Version:      tempest --version
  Help:         tempest [--help]

  Options:

  -u | --url=<url>      full URL to relay data to
  -f | --format=<fmt>   format to which the UDP data is repackaged:
                        0) JSON untranslated, 1) REST API, 2) Ecowitt
                        (default if omitted: 1)
  -i | --interval=<min> interval in minutes at which data is relayed:
                        0 <= min <= 30 (default if omitted: 1)
  -l | --log=<lev>      0) only errors
                        1) errors and warnings
                        2) errors, warnings and info (default if omitted)
                        3) errors, warnings, info and debug (everything)
  -d | --daemon         run as a service
  -t | --trace          relay data to the terminal standard output
  -s | --stop           stop the relay and exit gracefully
  -v | --version        print version information
  -h | --help           print this help

  Examples:

  tempest --url=http://hubitat.local:39501 --format=2 --interval=5
  tempest -u=192.168.1.100:39500 -l=1 -d
  tempest --stop
  ```
